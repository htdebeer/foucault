# Literate programming â€” Mixing markdown documents with programming code; Try 1

Looking at writing programming code in markdown, there are multiple ways to do
so. The most obvious way to add code to markdown is to enclose all code blocks
in between lines starting with, at least, three tildes.

~~~
# say, like this.
~~~

To run a literate program, then, is to find a way to get the code out the
document and feed it to the compiler or interpreter. A simple way to go about
that, could be to inspect each line in the document. If the line is part of a
code block, keep it, if not, discard it.

Let us interpret a document as a sequence of lines. We use a simple state
machine with two states, *in code block* and *out code block*, starting in out
of code block. If we encounter a code block delimiter as defined above, i.e.,
a line starting with three tildes, we change state to in code block. In that
state, every next line will be collected into the runnable program. Whenever
we encounter the code block delimiter we will discard that line. Furthermore,
all lines outside a code block will be discarded as well.

~~~{.ruby}
CODE_BLOCK_DELIMITER = /^~~~.*$/

def program_collector(document)
    program = []
    incode = false
    while not document.empty? do
        line = document.shift
        if line =~ CODE_BLOCK_DELIMITER then
            incode = ! incode
            next
        end

        program.push line if incode
    end

    program.join
end
~~~

Now, to test this simple program, we run it on this file.

~~~
document = File.readlines ARGV[0]
program = program_collector document
puts program
~~~

Of course, this being the first document, the program to create a runnable
program from it does not yet exists. To that end, we bootstrap this script. We
copy all the code into a new file, and then run that on this document.
