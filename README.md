Literate programming for any language - the narrative turn

**first prototype** 

This first prototype is meant to start exploring literate programming. This
exploration will allow me to better understand literate programming with
foucault and what
functionality foucault should offer to support (literate) programming best.

This first prototype is not intended for use in production environments!

See [the literate program about bootstrapping
foucault](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/htdebeer/foucault/blob/master/bootstrapping_foucault.html) for documentation about foucault.
