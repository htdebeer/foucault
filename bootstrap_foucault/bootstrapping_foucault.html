<h1 id="bootstrapping-foucault">Bootstrapping Foucault</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Foucault extracts the code from literate programs written in markdown. There are three ways to add code to a markdown document:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>indented code blocks: a sequence of lines indented with four spaces or a tab on top of the current indentation and enclosed by blank lines is treated as code. For example:</p>
<pre><code>while true do
    puts &quot;I am a code block&quot;
end</code></pre></li>
<li><p>inline code: text enclosed by `'s is treaded as piece of code. For example, <code>x = x + 1 if x &lt; 100</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>fenced code blocks: all lines in between two 'fences' are treated as code. A fence is a line starting with, at least, three tildes (<code>~</code>) or tick marks (```). The top fence is preceded by a blank line and the bottom fence is followed by a blank line. Furthermore, the bottom fence should start with at least the same amount and type of fence characters. For example:</p></li>
</ol>
<pre><code>start = &#39;~~~&#39;
while line =~ /^~~~.*/ do
    puts &quot;line is a code line&quot;
    line = next line
end</code></pre>
<p>Foucault extracts only code inside fenced code blocks, allowing the literate programmer to write about code without writing code by using indented code blocks or, when a very short piece of code, inline code.</p>
<p>Foucault is written as a literate program; this document is the foucault program. There is one problem, however, how can foucault's code be extracted from this document with foucault? It does not yet exist!</p>
<p>The solution is called <em>bootstrapping</em>. We create a simple executable program that can extract code from this document that, itself, is not a literate program. Of course, once that program is created, it can be added to this document as well, allowing it to extract itself. In this section the bootstrapping process is described in three phases.</p>
<h2 id="phase-0-simple-fenced-code-blocks">Phase 0: Simple Fenced Code Blocks</h2>
<p>The simplest way to add a fenced code block is to use fences of exactly three tildes.</p>
<pre><code>~~~
# say, like this.
~~~</code></pre>
<p>To run a literate program, then, is to find a way to get the code out the document and feed it to the compiler or interpreter. A simple way to go about that, could be to inspect each line in the document. If the line is part of a code block, keep it, if not, discard it.</p>
<p>Let us interpret a document as a sequence of lines. We use a simple state machine with two states, <em>in code block</em> and <em>out code block</em>, starting in out of code block. If we encounter a code block delimiter as defined above, i.e., a line starting with three tildes, we change state to in code block. In that state, every next line will be collected into the runnable program. Whenever we encounter the code block delimiter we will discard that line. Furthermore, all lines outside a code block will be discarded as well.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="dt">CODE_BLOCK_DELIMITER</span> = <span class="ot">/^~~~.*$/</span>

<span class="kw">def</span> program_collector(document)
    program = []
    incode = <span class="dv">false</span>
    while <span class="kw">not</span> document.empty? <span class="kw">do</span>
        line = document.shift
        <span class="kw">if</span> line =~ <span class="dt">CODE_BLOCK_DELIMITER</span> <span class="kw">then</span>
            incode = ! incode
            <span class="kw">next</span>
        <span class="kw">end</span>

        program.push line <span class="kw">if</span> incode
    <span class="kw">end</span>

    program.join
<span class="kw">end</span></code></pre>
<p>Now, to test this simple program, we run it on this document. When running the result, running it on this document, it should give the same result.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby">document = <span class="dt">File</span>.readlines <span class="dt">ARGV</span>[<span class="dv">0</span>]
program = program_collector document
puts program</code></pre>
<p>Of course, this being the first document, the program to create a runnable program from it does not yet exists. To that end, we bootstrap foucault by copying all code in this document, by hand, to a separate file and run that.</p>
<h2 id="phase-1-sizing-start-and-end">Phase 1: sizing start and end</h2>
<p>According to the pandoc manual, fenced code blocks are bit more complicated than just lines of code enclosed by two lines starting with three tildes. For one thing, the number of tildes might be longer than three. However, if so, the ending line should start with, at least, as many tildes, although more are allowed.</p>
<p>As code blocks cannot be nested — that just does not make sense —, we can adapt the first phase bootstrapping program simply by remembering and testing the number of tildes of the starting line. We introduce two functions to determine if a line is a fence and, if so, what length that fence is.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="dt">DELIMITER</span> = <span class="ot">/^(?&lt;fence&gt;(?&lt;prefix&gt;~~~)~*).*$/</span>

<p>Now, we adapt the program a bit.</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby">

            <span class="kw">end</span>

            <span class="co"># the line is not part of the code, ignore it and go to the next one</span>
            <span class="kw">next</span>

puts program</code></pre>
<p>Observe how the program is getting harder to read and we have not incorporated all the fence related rules yet.</p>
<h2 id="phase-2-two-kinds-of-fences">Phase 2: two kinds of fences</h2>
<p>Not only tildes can make up a fence, also the backtick can do so if a line starts with, at least, three backticks. This usage of the backtick to denote code is different from denoting code inline with a single backtick.</p>
<p>So, the delimiter of a code block can contain of three or more tildes or backticks. However, a block should end with the same symbols in the fence as in the fence it started with. Besides keeping track of the size of a fence, we should also keep track of the type of fence.</p>
<p>We could use these functions and adapt the original program, but the code will only get more complex. Instead, think about determining code blocks differently, not in the last place because there is another way to denote code blocks in markdown alltogether. What we want to know, given the current state and the current line: do we collect this line as part of the program or not?</p>
<p>One way to go about is to extend the state machine and add in what kind code block we're dealing with. So, the initial state still is <em>out of code</em>, but to get into a code block, we've got two options: a backtick fence or a tilde fence. Besides keeping the state, we'll also keep track of the size of the fence. Let us build that state machine.</p>
